# Rubiks-Cube
## Description (Kunal)
- General info about rubiks cube
- about world records, championship
- various algos to solve available
## Theory
- explain about how we take input- explain opencv code (Ayushi)
- then algos invlolved to solve the cube (Chamma)
- explain about CFOP Algo (Chamma)
## Usage
### Notations (Kunal)
- Table with 1,2,3,4,5,6 legends
### Giving Input (Ayushi)
- How to click images - should include reference i.e, white down blue right/left---to be confirmed
- how to name the images
- how to run the python file
- explain the output which we get after running the above command
### Solving the cube
- how to give array input obtained after running CubeInput.py file
- How to run the file gcc command
- explain the output - attach output example
### Demo Input
The repo contains a [demo](https://github.com/KKVANONYMOUS/Rubiks-Cube/tree/master/demo) directory with [images](https://github.com/KKVANONYMOUS/Rubiks-Cube/tree/master/demo/images) folder for sample input for the `CubeInput.py` program which will generate the corresponding face matrix, to be given as input to `CFOP.cpp` program.
Or else the user can directly give the face matrix present in [Sample_Input_For_CFOP.txt](https://github.com/KKVANONYMOUS/Rubiks-Cube/blob/master/demo/Sample_Input_For_CFOP.txt) file as input to `CFOP.cpp` file.

For more info regarding giving input to the program you can refer to [Giving Input](#giving-input-ayushi) section.
#### Shuffle function
This function gives additional option to shuffle the cube in order to test the code for different cases. Just give the cube rotation input in the form of numbers ranging from 0-11 as decribed in [Notations](#notations-kunal) and press 12 when you are done with the shuffiling.
